Bootcamp
========

Bootcamp is a series of exercises that can be assigned to designers as Gitlab issues  
to a project fork of thesdk_template residing on a Gitlab server. These exercises are managed by
`thsdk_helpers/bootcamp_generator/generate_bootcamp.py` script.

If you are familiar with controlling gitlab with gitlab-python interface and operating i
with gitlab tokens, generating tthe bootcamp should be quite straightforward.

To study the current contents of the bootcamp and to give an idea about useful exercises to
get familiar with TheSydeKick, the bootcamp issues are provided below.
